  ## <a id="INSTALLATION"> INSTALLATION</a>
  Node, NPM I Inquierer

  ## <a id="USAGE"> USAGE</a>
  The application can be initialized by running the "node index" command in the terminal to start after making sure the required dependencies have been installed. Once the program is run the user will fill out the relative information with the relative role that they have been  prompted. Upon filling out this field the console will log back the object of the class that was just created to confirm the information and make it visible for the user. The user can then create as many interns or engineers as they like but once hitting the "NO" option when prompted would they like to add any more users the application will then run the generation script that will then create the "team.html" file which will then be displayable to the user.
